<h2>Description</h2>

<p>For this homework assignment I was provided with some pre-existing HTML and CSS code. The object of this assignment was to create a week day scheduler that runs from 9 AM - 5 PM. 

Depending on the hour of the day, the time blocks will be color coded. Past is represented by the color grey and the user is blocked from inputting any text. If it is the present hour, the time block will be red and the user is able to input text. If future hours are displayed, then the time block will be colored green and the user will be able to input text.

The user is able to add reminders for each time block and click the save button. Once the reminder has been saved, the information will then remain even once the page has been refreshed.</p>

<h2>My Experience</h2>

<p>This assignment was fun and challenging at the same time. I enjoyed implementing a function to color the time blocks depending on the current time using moment.js. I learned a lot more about local storage and now understand more about setting keys with values and also getting keys with values.</p>
